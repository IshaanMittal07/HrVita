## 🚨 Why We Chose This Problem
### **Late Detection**
- HID is severely **underdiagnosed**—only **~4.42%** of cases are detected early.  
- Over **60–70%** of delirium cases go unnoticed, leading to longer hospital stays, cognitive decline, and higher mortality (Sources 1–2).

### **Companionship Matters**
- Delirious patients often feel **scared, isolated, and disoriented**.  
- Family involvement reduces delirium by **54%**, proving companionship is a key protective factor (Sources 3–4).  
- Vita includes a **chatbot + family dashboard** to support emotional well-being.

## 🧠 Research Snapshot
Studies show that **HRV + machine learning** (SVM, ELM, RBF kernels, etc.) can detect **~17.17%** of delirium cases early—comparable to full clinical models but with less data.  
This inspired our **real-time HRV wearable design**.

## 🔧 What We’ve Built
- 🟦 **ESP32 wearable** (C++)  
- 🔴 **Pulse oximeter sensor** (HR + HRV across 100-interval windows)  
- 🌐 **Web dashboard + companion chatbot**  
- 🧪 Fully wired + soldered hardware system  
- 📊 Stable HRV computation through serial monitor

---

## ⚠️ Current Challenges
- Sensor accuracy + placement sensitivity  
- Improving HRV calculation algorithms  
- Research-backed mapping: HRV patterns → HID risk  
- Bluetooth → website integration  
- Designing final wearable case

---

## 📅 Next Steps (Before Demo)
- 🔵 Add Bluetooth for real-time data streaming  
- 🔧 Tune sensor settings (LED brightness, sampling rate, ADC range, etc.)  
- 📦 Finalize wearable case design  
- 🧪 Run end-to-end integration tests
